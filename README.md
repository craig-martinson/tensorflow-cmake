# tensorflow-cmake

## Introduction

Example of building and linking tensorflow as a static library to a Windows c++ program using cmake

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2017
- Python 3.6
- git

## Instructions

From a windows command line execute the following commands:

``` batch
git clone https://github.com/craig-martinson/tensorflow-cmake.git
cd tensorflow-cmake
build_solution.cmd
```

This `build_solution.cmd` batch file will perform the following tasks:

1. Download cmake if required
2. Clone the tensorflow repository
3. Open an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017
4. Build tensorflow static libraries optimized for Intel AVX2
5. Build and link the example c++ solution
